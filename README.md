# Subforms

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.2.

The main idea is to create reusable components inside a single or muliple forms(later on).

## Background
The need for that came from the place I work where we have basically all of subpages of our app a filter. 
This filter should be a reusable component through all of the app. But the problems is that the inputs differ, and sometimes a lot.
So I thought of making a filter component where it could handle multiple kinds of inputs, which would be other components as well.
On our case we're using PrimeNG and we have legacy code(Angular version 6 at the time I wrote that) but in here I'm using a newer
version of Angular. All of that just to make a proof of concept and keep this example in here if future implementations 
or tests and possible tweaks are needed.
